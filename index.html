                <p>Many people do a day trip to the Munduk area for the temple at Tamblingan Lake. Actually staying in Munduk will give you the time to see even more beautiful places. The area is a little cooler and can feel really comfortable. Waterfalls, swings, coffee, trekking, Munduk has it all. From Gadugan to Munduk is a solid 2.5-hour drive.</p>

                <h3>New UK Prime Minister Liz Truss vows to 'get Britain working again'</h3>
                <img src="./assets/news.jpeg" alt="news">
                <p>She insisted Britain could “ride out the storm” of the twin economic and energy crises facing the nation, while acknowledging the “severe global headwinds” she is up against.
                    She promised three early priorities as PM — delivering on the economy, on energy and on the crisis-ridden National Health Service, reiterating her promise of “bold” tax cuts and reform.

                <h3>Gareth Southgate doesn't make it out in time to talk to Channel 4, who must be thinking they've been sold a right pup with this England deal.</h3>
                <img src="./assets/sport.png" alt="sport">
                <p>That's five matches they've shown. Three defeats, two draws, and the only goal England have scored is a Harry Kane penalty. Not sure they've transmitted anything as relentlessly downbeat since the days of Murun Buchstansangur.</p>
